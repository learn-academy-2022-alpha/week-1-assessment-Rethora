# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement checks for a boolean (value of true or false). If this condition evaluates to true, then it will execute the code block following it. However if it evaluates to false, it will skip the code block following it and check the next condition (if there is one).

  Researched answer: A conditional statement is used for checking a specific condition and executing code based on that condition. The types of conditional statements are if, else, else if, and switch-case (which I definitely knew and should have included in my answer). I could have probably also included that the syntax of these are the keyword followed by parentheses (with the condition inside) and followed curly braces (with the code inside of those).

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a versioning control software. It allows developers to make changes to a code base on their local machine while a working version is intact. Delvelopers can update the code on their local and make changes to it without directly effecting the working code. With that being said, Github can be thought of like the "Cloud". This is were code can be inspected and approved to be merged into the main branch (working code). It's also a way to communicate what needs work or to be changed before it is merged with the main code.

  Researched answer: Git is a free open source version control software. It is useful for staging areas and multiple workflows. Git allows multiple collaborators to work on a project simultaneously from different local machines.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Logical operators will return a boolean value. Some Logical Operators include strict equality, loose equality, AND(&&) and OR(||).

  Researched answer: So, obviously I need some work with operator terms and in general. There are equality, relational and logical operators. Equality operators include strict (===) and loose (==). Relational operators compares relationship between two values(> and <). Logical operators include and (&&), or (||) and not(!). These will all return a boolean that can be useful for checking certain conditions.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the position of an element in a collection. Computers start counting at zero, so the index of the first element in an array would be zero. A value would be the actual piece of data in the collection.

  Researched answer: Indices are read-only properties that indicate the position of the element within an array.

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: A sequence of repeated tasks to carry out. Those tasks being a series of steps/instructions.

  Researched answer: Upon futher research, I have read many defintions and they are all relatively the same. An iteration is the process of repeating a procedure a certain number of times, or until a condition is met.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The roles of pair programming include a "driver" and a "navigator". The driver is responsible for having their hands on the keyboard and doing the actual computer work and the navigator is responsible for watching the driver. More specifically, the navigator is watching for spelling/puncutaion errors as well as guiding the driver in the appropriate direction. Both roles are equally important and if done correctly can result in very efficient work.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a good strategy for dividing the workload evenly. The approach requires a lot of communication. The roles should be switched every 10 to 20 minutes, with multiple breaks. The driver is responsible for entering the information and following the instructions from the navigator.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: These can take functions as parameters and return a function.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. This is useful to check if your code is correct.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that can store various keyed collections with complexity.

4. Method: A method is a function as a property of an object.

5. Classes: A template/blueprint for creating objects. They are good for excapsulating data and functions that manipulate other data.
